Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a maker/programmer with a background in gamedev. There's a smattering of different projects on here. If you're looking for mostly creative stuff, you can check out [my website](https://yostlabs.net) which has some live demos. Alternatively, I have some useful utilities like a [minimal CMake template](https://github.com/danstuff/cmake-starter) or a simple program for [embedding images into C/C++ code.](https://github.com/danstuff/bmp2c)  

I'm currently working on my website and some LLM-adjacent software. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about my work or if you'd like to collaborate!
