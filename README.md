## Hello! :turtle:

Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a maker/programmer with a background in gamedev. There's a smattering of different projects on here:
 - I have some useful utilities like a [minimal CMake template](https://github.com/danstuff/cmake-starter) and a simple program for [embedding images into C/C++ code.](https://github.com/danstuff/bmp2c)  
 - You can also check out [my website](https://yostlabs.net) which has live demos and more of my creative work.

I'm currently working on my website and some LLM-adjacent software. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about my work or if you'd like to collaborate!
